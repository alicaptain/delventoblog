        If only some of ‘you’ would be able to translate this to English
        “procreatinoperly”, I’d believe that you’re at least as intelligent as
        me.{" "}

        This is Ali. Calling, some-times yelling out from centuriesfilled
        information, wisdom and a thousand year of retardness aged like wine
        with aromas and scents of mistakes and painful experiences. Houston!
        Give up expecting life from Mars, it had more water then you can find
        now when i was a child and there were still some crocodelic mammals
        swimming in very deep of them. But cold weather is also not very good
        when you get too much used to. And that cold weather liquadites the
        atmosphere you breath. And when it’s up above the surface with a
        centrifugal power of a rotating spherical surface which has less gravity
        than the big neighbor where they start to leave with the help of time...
        You can find their skeletons if you dig enough under the sand happened
        after the hills got dry, no moist, no plants, no softness between hot
        days and cold nights...

        This is a cruel universe with really interesting gifts that can
        disappear until you realize their value and how lovely were they ‘on
        time’... I would like to ask, please, do watch out while knowing it will
        be useless request.
